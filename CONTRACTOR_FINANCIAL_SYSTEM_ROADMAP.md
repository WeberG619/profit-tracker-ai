# Contractor Financial Management System - Strategic Roadmap

## Vision
Transform Profit Tracker AI from a receipt processor into a complete financial management system for contractors - simpler than QuickBooks but with all the features they actually need.

## Core Problem We're Solving
Contractors currently use multiple systems:
- Receipt tracking (often manual)
- Invoice creation (Word/Excel)
- Payment tracking (spreadsheets)
- Job costing (QuickBooks)
- Collections management (memory/notes)

**Our Solution**: One simple system that does it all, with AI to make it smart.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Document Management (Current + 2 weeks)
### 1.1 Invoice Support
- **Track Type**: Add document_type field (receipt/invoice/quote/purchase_order)
- **Direction**: inbound (expenses) vs outbound (income)
- **Status**: paid/pending/overdue
- **AI Recognition**: Train AI to auto-detect document type

### 1.2 Accounts Receivable Dashboard
- **Pending Invoices**: Show what's owed to you
- **Overdue Alerts**: Automatic reminders for collections
- **Job Profitability**: Real income vs expenses per job
- **Cash Flow View**: What's coming in vs going out

### Database Changes Needed:
```sql
-- Update Receipt table to Document table
ALTER TABLE receipt RENAME TO document;
ALTER TABLE document ADD COLUMN document_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'receipt';
ALTER TABLE document ADD COLUMN direction VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'expense'; -- expense/income
ALTER TABLE document ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'paid'; -- paid/pending/overdue
